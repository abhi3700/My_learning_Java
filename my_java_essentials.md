* #### Test code
  If for example your file is my_file.java:

  ```
    class MyClass
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
         {
           System.out.println("Hello World");
         }
    }
  ```

  You want to do:

  ```javac my_file.java```
  and then

  ```java MyClass``` # The name of the class, not file
  ##### NOTE: However, it is a common convention to give classes and files the same name.
